MSc Big Data Analytics from Birmingham City University

# Abstract:
This study intends to investigate how Business intelligence and Machine learning are 
applied to real estate data in the Canadian market. It will examine the many strategies, 
techniques, and instruments used in this situation and point out their advantages and 
disadvantages. Additionally, the paper will include a thorough analysis of pertinent 
studies, research papers, and business reports that have advanced understanding in 
this field. Also, this study aims to shed light on the potential of BI and ML in 
empowering decision makers in the Canadian real estate market by evaluating the 
existing literature and gaining insights from real-world applications. The importance of 
data-driven decision making in a sector where precise forecasting, risk management, 
and market information are crucial will be emphasised. The project demonstrates how 
Raw data is extracted from the website and carefully select and stored in PostgreSQL 
which was then used to manage data and transform it through a pipeline in Pentaho. 
Making various reports in Power BI later for improved decision-making. Additionally, a 
proper feature selection is carried out by correlation analysis prior to the machine 
learning algorithm's implementation. Random oversampling is also used to address 
the issue of an unbalanced dataset. To improve the model's accuracy, this is being 
done. To choose the best suitable algorithm, the model's accuracy has been evaluated 
in comparison to other algorithms, such as Random Forest, Linear Regression, 
Elastic.net and much more.


# Instructions:

Integrating Business Intelligence and Machine Learning for Enhanced Decision Making and Data Handling in Real Estate.PDF contains Thesis of my Masters Project.

Data Extraction file contains Python code to extract the Data from website called Realtor.ca which is the first step of this project.

Pentaho Files contains Main Job file and all the transformations. As Pentaho is the Middle step after Data extraction. (Note: please recheck the file path in Job file)

You need to Create different tables in your local PostgresSQL database.

PowerBI file shows the visualization I have created from the Data.

Machine Learning and NLP algorithms are applied to get House Price prediction.
